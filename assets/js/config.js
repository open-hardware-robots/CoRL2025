    `Open-source hardware is increasingly becoming a shared foundation for research and industry, yet it entails physical risks absent in software, such as insufficient strength, heat generation, and accidents caused by moving parts. This keynote focuses on risk assessment and safety design as essential components of open hardware development. First, it examines methods for disclosing assessments of such hazards. Second, it highlights the importance of safety standardization and reproducibility in academic research. Third, it addresses issues of standards, responsibility, and practical implementation as a bridge to industry. By embedding safety design into the core of open-source hardware, the research community can contribute to building a societal infrastructure capable of safe coexistence with humans.`, 'Yuki Nakagawa is the CEO, President, and Founder of RT Corporation, a robotics company in Tokyo, Japan since 2005.

    'Designing and Teaching Low-Cost Dexterous Robot Hands',
		"Think about typing on a keyboard, using chopsticks, or hammering a nail—our hands allow us to interact with the world with remarkable precision and adaptability. In contrast, robotic manipulation is still largely limited to basic grippers and suction cups that lack this level of dexterity. A key reason is that truly dexterous robot hands are notoriously difficult to build and control.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll share our work on democratizing access to dexterity through robot hands such as our LEAP Hands—low-cost, highly capable hardware and software packages designed for research and education. I’ll also discuss how we use large-scale human motion data from the internet and modern simulation techniques to enable our robot hands to learn complex, human-like behavior.",

    'What defines a successful open-source hardware project? In this talk, I will examine two key dimensions—accessibility and capability—and apply them to the evolution of the Berkeley Humanoid project. Our prototype, the Berkeley Humanoid, was an initial test of building a humanoid from scratch, but only released the training code. To emphasize accessibility, we developed the Berkeley Humanoid Lite, a fully open-source hardware and software platform designed to lower barriers for the community. Looking ahead, the next generation, Berkeley Humanoid V2, will deliver major advances in capability and will also be released as fully open-source in both hardware and software. Together, these efforts reflect our vision for open-source humanoid robotics: platforms that are not only accessible and capable today, but also fully open and reproducible for the community in the future.',  "Qiayuan Liao is a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by Prof. Koushil Sreenath.
